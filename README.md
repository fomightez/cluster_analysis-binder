### Details


See [Avoiding common pitfalls when clustering biological data](https://stke.sciencemag.org/content/9/432/re6) by Tom Ronan, Zhijie Qi, and Kristen M. Naegle (2016) for useful background.

Notebook content demonstrates:

- Hierarchical clustering
- Block model and Bi-clustering
- k-means clustering
- DBSCAN clustering (DBSCAN = Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- HDBSCAN clustering (HSBSCAN = Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- Comparing clustering results
- Examining variation in clustering results



Links to [a demo](https://github.com/cornhundred/citibike-clustergrammer2) that uses [clustergrammer2](https://clustergrammer.readthedocs.io/clustergrammer2.html), which is an interactive heatmap Jupyter widget built to help researchers interactively explore single cell data (e.g. scRNA-seq). Although that is not the type of data used in the demonstration.

#### Technical notes

This repository builds largely on [my binderized 3D scatter plot repostiory](https://github.com/fomightez/3Dscatter_plot-binder) for the needed packages as I started development there. I later added Scikit-Learn (Sklearn) so didn't need to install it in this repostiory. Kept advanced items from [my binderized 3D scatter plot repostiory](https://github.com/fomightez/3Dscatter_plot-binder) even though not intially needed here because I hope to add the use of widgets for adding data here as well.
