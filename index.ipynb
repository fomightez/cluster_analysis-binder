    "- [Here](https://github.com/cornhundred/citibike-clustergrammer2) shows a heatmap visualization of public data from CITI Bike from July 2019 of over 2.18 million rides, displaying the connections between stations using Clustergrammer2. Go to [there](https://github.com/cornhundred/citibike-clustergrammer2) and press the 'launch binder' button to see the Voila form of the notebook. [Clustergrammer2](https://clustergrammer.readthedocs.io/clustergrammer2.html) is an interactive heatmap Jupyter widget to help researchers interactively explore single cell data (e.g. scRNA-seq). The notebook/Voila page also uses UMAP which is popular for analysis of single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq)."
